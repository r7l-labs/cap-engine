# capjs documentation

Welcome to the capjs documentation. This folder contains a short "getting started" guide, API reference, and example walkthroughs.

Contents:

- `getting-started.md` — how to run the examples and basic usage
- `api.md` — module and class reference for the core modules
- `examples.md` — overview of included examples and how they work

- `using-minified.md` — how to import and use the bundled `dist/capjs.min.js` in offline or online projects

This documentation is intentionally concise and focuses on developer getting-started steps and the available public API.
